### Overview
The Maurisource_RechargePayments module helps manage product syncing and recurring orders with RechargePayments, using Stripe keys for payments.

### Setup Requirements
- **Stripe Payment Method:** You need to set up Stripe as the payment method for the module to work.

### How It Works

#### Product Management

##### Adding or Updating Products
- When you add or update a product, the module creates a task to sync it with RechargePayments.
- A background process (cron job) regularly checks for new products and updates them on RechargePayments. It also updates the product's status once it's successfully synced.

##### Deleting Products
- To remove a product from RechargePayments, you disable its subscription. This triggers a task to delete the product from RechargePayments. Once deleted, the module updates the status accordingly.

#### Order Management

##### Creating Orders
- Whenever a new order is placed, the module prepares it for RechargePayments. It ensures the order is authorized for processing.
- A scheduled task monitors these orders, authorizing them on RechargePayments once confirmed. It retries a few times in case of errors.

##### Order Payments
- When an invoice is generated and paid, the module captures the payment in RechargePayments. This completes the payment process for the order.

#### Refunds

##### Processing Refunds
- If a refund is requested, the module handles it by initiating a refund request through RechargePayments. Once processed successfully, it updates the refund status.
